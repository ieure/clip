One of the things which has kept Common Lisp out of my day-to-day
toolbox is a lack of clear instructions how to get up and running
with it — not in the REPL, but building small utility programs that
can be called from the shell.  I tend to reach for Python or Emacs
Lisp, since I have a good grasp and they’re readily available, but
I’ve always felt that Common Lisp could be a potent tool for these
applications.

Building a project in Lisp can be confusing, because Lisp itself
works so differently to other languages.  While there are
fundamental similarities to other [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOT_compiler][AOT]] languages, the mechanisms are
very different than most people are used to.

After reading my friend Steve’s [[http://stevelosh.com/blog/2018/08/a-road-to-common-lisp/][Road to Common Lisp]], I was inspired
to figure this out.  Many thanks to him for helping me with the
proofreading and aiding my understanding where it lacked.


* Goals
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       2e1e0df8-5d67-476c-bceb-a203d9d4e67a
  :END:

The overarching goal is to explain how to put together a Common
Lisp Program, by walking through it step by step.  The end result
should be a functional, well-understood program.

It isn’t a tutorial on Lisp programming, because there are already
[[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/][great resources]] [[http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html][for that]].

It doesn’t rathole on every possible approach you could possibly
use, but treads and illuminates the beaten path.  It explains the
less obvious nuts-and-bolts of building Common Lisp programs by
example: Where to put source code, how to make a binary, how to use
libraries.


* Running the Examples
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       28ff9746-0d0b-4ff2-b69c-eaaf11c79805
  :END:

If you’d like to run the example code, you’ll need to install [[http://www.sbcl.org/][Steel
Bank Common Lisp (SBCL)]] (for all of them) and [[https://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]] (for the
last two).  The Quicklisp installation is unusual if you’re coming
from other languages, so it’s also fine to read along and see what
things are like before investing in a Lisp environment.

This is written in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] style using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-source-code.html#Working-with-source-code][org-babel]].
All program output should be very, very close to what you’d see if
you ran those programs.  The [[https://github.com/ieure/clip/blob/source/source.org][original Org document]] and [[https://github.com/ieure/cl-hello/tree/output/][source code
extracted from it]] are available in [[https://github.com/ieure/clip/tree/master][my GitHub repo]].


* Background
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       6f8aafb5-41c7-4913-a3e6-846e23c9e3d6
  :END:

A typical compiler is a standalone executable which runs one OS
process for each file, producing a binary artifact corresponding to
its input; a linker executable combines those into the final binary.
Some compilers output an intermediate representation (IR), such
assembly language, then spawn a separate executable to assemble
them.

Each executable represents a capability boundary.  Their
functionality is only usable in one way: by executing them with no
context except what’s provided on their commandline.

For example, if you wanted the compiler to create the assembler
listing in memory, then have the assembler work on that (skipping
the whole compiler-output/assembler-input dance), you’re out of
luck; it can’t be done.  Or if you wanted to go one better and have
the compiler create an in-memory [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][AST]] the assembler can work on
directly, this is also impossible.

Another way to think about this is that most languages have a close
relationship between /programs/ and /binaries/, and typically a
single binary can run a single program.  This wall precludes tight
integration of multiple programs, because they can only communicate
across the I/O constructs afforded to OS processes.

Common Lisp does not work this way.  Much like interpreted
languages, everything is loaded into one environment, and all
functionality is accessible in the same way — by calling a function.
However, Lisp goes much further than other languages.

For example, Python 3 ships with five executables:

#+begin_src shell
  dpkg -L python3-minimal | grep -c /bin/
#+end_src

#+results:
: 5


This includes the interpreter, a byte-compiler, another program to
remove the files the byte-compiler creates, etc.

OpenJDK has 8:

#+begin_src shell
  dpkg -L openjdk-11-jre-headless | grep -c /bin/
#+end_src

#+results:
: 8


GCC has 16:

#+begin_src shell
  dpkg -L gcc | grep -c /bin/
#+end_src

#+results:
: 16


And in order to actually /use/ GCC, you also need binutils, which
has many more:

#+begin_src shell
  dpkg -L binutils | grep -c /bin/
#+end_src

#+results:
: 19


Can you guess how many Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) has?

#+begin_src shell
  dpkg -L sbcl | grep -c /bin/
#+end_src

#+results:
: 1


Just one, =/usr/bin/sbcl=.  Everything that can be done with SBCL is
done inside of the environment it provides.


** The Environment; Images
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       e85d69bc-4749-4b92-91db-a6ffa5245cee
   :END:

When Common Lisp starts, it initializes a *Lisp environment* in the
computer’s memory, then evaluates a *toplevel function*.  The
environment contains the Lisp language and tools; the standard
toplevel is the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop][REPL]].  When code is typed into the REPL, or loaded
from a file, it’s added to the environment and can be used by other
programs inside it.

The state of the environment can be saved to disk in a *Lisp
image*[fn:1], and restored by giving that image to =sbcl(1)=, or
executing the image directly from the shell.  When the image is
saved, a different toplevel function can be specified.

These are the building blocks for making executables.  Code is
loaded into the environment, then an image is created from that
state, with the toplevel set to the desired entry point.

[fn:1] SBCL refers to them as "cores."


* Version 1: Quick & Dirty
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       d02c988c-2f89-4503-a40a-94040945d84d
  :END:

With all that out of the way, it’s time to make a traditional
"Hello, World" program.  This program will:

1. Run from a shell.
2. Use the first argument given to it as the name of the person or
   thing to greet.

Starting from the ground up, the function to create the greeting:

#+name: greet
#+begin_src lisp
  (defun greet (whom)
    "Create a greeting message for WHOM."
    (format nil "Hello, ~A." whom))
#+end_src

Trying this in the REPL shows that it works:

#+begin_src lisp
  (greet "World")
#+end_src

#+results:
: Hello, World.


** The Toplevel Function
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       a8484f23-fb99-466b-9279-9a5b5a6b76f3
   :END:

To satisfy the first requirement, a toplevel function is needed —
this will be evaluated when the image is restored, handling the
command-line arguments and printing the greeting.

I named the toplevel function =MAIN=, but it can be called
anything.  Any function which accepts zero arguments can be used as
a toplevel.

#+name: main
#+begin_src lisp
  (defun main ()
    "Greet someone, or something."
    (write-line (greet (first (uiop:command-line-arguments))))

    (uiop:quit))
#+end_src

There are two functions in here that may be new to you.

The command-line arguments given to an executable aren’t turned
into arguments for the toplevel function, as with other languages;
they’re returned from =UIOP:COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENTS=.

As one might expect, =UIOP:QUIT= terminates the process.

Neither of these functions are part of the Common Lisp standard;
both come from UIOP, which bridges some of the gaps in the spec,
and between implementations.


** Packages
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       c1f5614a-6c86-4590-8497-3d61c076ec79
   :END:

The next thing to get a handle on is packages.  This terminology is
different than in other languages, which use it in the sense of
"package manager," meaning a downloadable library and/or mechanism
to install them.

In Common Lisp, *a package is a namespace* which contains symbols.
The symbols can be defined in the package, like =MAIN= and =GREET=,
or they can be symbols inherited from other packages, like =DEFUN=
and =FORMAT= (which both come from the =COMMON-LISP= package[fn:2]).

The Hello World example should define a package, called =HELLO=.

*Packages must be explicitly defined before they can be used*.
Many languages treat a statement like:

#+begin_src go
  package hello
#+end_src

As definition /and/ use, i.e. everything declared in this file is
implicitly put in the =hello= package.

The similar-looking Lisp analogue of this is =IN-PACKAGE=:

#+name: in-package-hello
#+begin_src lisp
  (in-package :hello)
#+end_src

While the code is similar, the semantics are different.  This
/only/ sets the active package, it won’t create =:hello=[fn:3] if it
doesn’t exist.  Creating the package is an explicit step which must
be done first.

[[http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_defpkg.htm][The =DEFPACKAGE= macro]] creates a package.  It takes a symbol naming
it:

#+name: packages-bare
#+begin_src lisp
  (defpackage :hello)
#+end_src

In Lisp, newly-created packages are /completely empty/, and don’t
even include core language functionality like =DEFUN=.  Those
symbols can be used to by qualifying them with the package name,
but in most cases, it’s desirable to use them directly.  Adding a
=(:use …)= form inside =DEFPACKAGE= will copy other packages’
exported symbols into the package being defined:

#+begin_src lisp
  (defpackage :hello
    (:use :common-lisp))
#+end_src

If you hypothetically wanted to use to more packages, their symbols
would need to be added after =:common-lisp=[fn:4].  Note that this
should be used with care, since updates to those packages could
collide with the symbols in =:hello=.

In the same way that defining and using a package are separate,
*loading and using a package are also completely separate
operations*.  While many languages have an =import= mechanism which
both loads /and/ uses, Lisp doesn’t work this way; =:foo= and
=:bar= must have been loaded already.

[fn:2] =:CL= is an alias for the =:COMMON-LISP= package, so =(:use
:cl)= is a common equivalent.

[fn:3] You may note that I’ve written the name of the package as
=HELLO= (which it is), but it’s in the code as =:hello=.  For a deeper
explanation on why this is the case, I recommend [[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/programming-in-the-large-packages-and-symbols.html][the chapter on
Packages and Symbols]] from [[http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/][Programming in the Large]].  In the mean time,
you’ll just have to trust that it’s right and I know what I’m
doing.

[fn:4] =:cl= is an alias for =:common-lisp=, so it’s common to see
that in code in the wild.


*** Exports
    :PROPERTIES:
    :ID:       07bc4017-4a6c-4708-a814-b90b4e09882a
    :END:

The last package-related topic to cover is exported symbols.  When
a symbol is exported, it may be used by packages; the set of
exported symbols comprises the public API of a package.
Non-exported symbols should only be used within the same package.

Many languages specify visibility symbol-by-symbol, at the point
of definition:

#+begin_src java
  public int hashCode()
#+end_src

Lisp declares exported symbols when the /package containing them/
is defined, using the =(:export …)= form:

#+name: packages
#+begin_src lisp
  (defpackage :hello
    (:use :common-lisp)
    (:export :greet :main))
#+end_src


** Tying it All Together
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       f0c29ebe-29f5-4dd6-8eff-31c186564b2c
   :END:

The complete source for Hello World now looks like this:

#+name: hello
#+begin_src lisp
  (defpackage :hello
    (:use :common-lisp)
    (:export :greet :main))

  (in-package :hello)

  (defun greet (whom)
    "Create a greeting message for WHOM."
    (format nil "Hello, ~A." whom))

  (defun main ()
    "Greet someone, or something."
    (write-line (greet (first (uiop:command-line-arguments))))

    (uiop:quit))
#+end_src


** Building an Image
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       45058667-e3ed-4a9e-b7d5-0829240109ca
   :END:

Because the Common Lisp toolchain exists inside the Lisp
environment, build scripts for Common Lisp project are written in,
you guessed it, Lisp.

The first thing the build script should do is load the source of
the program, which I’ve placed in =hello.lisp=:

#+name: load-hello
#+begin_src lisp
  (load "hello.lisp")
#+end_src

Then, tell Lisp to dump the image into an executable, which will
call =MAIN= when invoked:

#+name: make-executable
#+begin_src lisp
  (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello"
   :toplevel 'hello:main
   :executable t)
#+end_src

I’m using SBCL for these examples, and =SB-EXT:SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE=
is the SBCL way of doing this.  The precise incantation will vary
based on Lisp implementation, because it’s not part of the Common
Lisp standard.

The call to =SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE= *could* be put at the end of
=hello.lisp= for this example, but it’s is a poor separation of
concerns for anything more complex than one-off scripts.  Its
rightful place is =build.lisp=.

The complete build script goes into =build.lisp= and looks like:

#+name: build-lisp
#+begin_src lisp
  (load "hello.lisp")

  (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello"
   :toplevel 'hello:main
   :executable t)
#+end_src

Executing the build script with =sbcl(1)= will produce the binary:

#+name: build-v1
#+begin_src shell
  sbcl --non-interactive --load build.lisp
#+end_src

#+results: build-v1
#+begin_example
  This is SBCL 1.4.16.debian, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

#+end_example

Running it shows the message:

#+name: run-hello-world
#+begin_src shell
  ./hello World
#+end_src

#+results: run-hello-world
: Hello, World.


Passing in the name of the current user also works:

#+begin_src shell
  ./hello $(whoami)
#+end_src

#+results:
: Hello, ieure.


Now that the program works, and you hopefully understand why and
how, it’s time to tear it down and rebuild it a few times.


* Version 2: Package Structure
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       9a2c28e6-c099-4c25-a62b-b24ba17f52ef
  :END:

Having all the code in one file is fine for a toy, but larger
programs benefit from more organization.  If the core functionality
is split from the CLI, other projects (or other parts of the same
project) can reuse the greeting function without the CLI code.

Also, Lisp packages can span files, so it’s not good practice to put
the package definition in one of the /N/ files that represent its
contents.

What this should look like is:

- =build.lisp=
- =packages.lisp=
  - =src/=
    - =greet.lisp=
    - =main.lisp=

The organization is different, but the contents of the files are
almost exactly the same.

The package definition is identical to v1, but moved into =packages.lisp=:

#+begin_src lisp
  (defpackage :hello
    (:use :common-lisp)
    (:export :greet :main))
#+end_src

The greeting code is moved to =src/greet.lisp=.  It’s identical,
except it has to declare the package it belongs to.

#+name: v2-greet
#+begin_src lisp
  (in-package :hello)

  ;; Unchanged from v1
  (defun greet (whom)
    "Create a greeting message for WHOM."
    (format nil "Hello, ~A." whom))
#+end_src

The CLI code moves to =src/main.lisp=, and also declares what
package it’s in:

#+name: v2-main
#+begin_src lisp
  (in-package :hello)

  ;; Unchanged from v1
  (defun main ()
    "Greet someone, or something."
    (write-line (greet (first (uiop:command-line-arguments))))

    (uiop:quit))
#+end_src

The =build.lisp= script needs to load the new pieces in the correct
order.  Since packages must be defined before they’re used,
=packages.lisp= needs to be loaded before either of the files in
=src/=; since =MAIN= calls =GREET=, the file containing =GREET= must
be loaded before the one with =MAIN=:

#+begin_src lisp
  (load "packages.lisp")                  ; Load package definition
  (load "src/greet.lisp")                 ; Load the core
  (load "src/main.lisp")                  ; Load the toplevel

  ;; Unchanged from v1
  (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello"
   :toplevel 'hello:main
   :executable t)
#+end_src

Building and running works the same way:

#+begin_src shell
  sbcl --non-interactive --load build.lisp
  ./hello World
#+end_src

#+results:
#+begin_example
  This is SBCL 1.4.16.debian, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

* Version 3: Systems
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       cef731d2-6e5d-4636-89a6-58d0483a51b2
  :END:

The next yak in the recursive shave is *systems*.  Packages [[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/util/html/cltl/clm/node111.html#XPACK][are part
of the Lisp language specification]], but systems are not; they’re
provided by a library.  The dominant systems library at the time of
writing is [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/][ASDF]], which means "Another System Definition Facility."
ASDF is a de facto standard, and comes bundled with both SBCL and
Quicklisp.

Systems and packages are orthogonal, but since they both deal with
some of the same parts of the project, and the names often overlap,
it can get confusing.

A package is *a way of organizing the symbols of a project inside
the Lisp environment*.  Lisp doesn’t have a convention for
determining what package things belong to based on the path or
filename.  One package can be split across multiple files, or one
file can contain multiple packages.

A system is *a description of /how/ to load /part/ of a project into
the environment*.  A system can load multiple packages, or it can
load a subset of one package.  Systems encapsulate the list and
order of files needed to produce a usable package.

Further complicating things, *one project can have multiple
systems*.  A system is a view into /part/ of a project, and
different code may need different pieces.  For example, test code
will need the test library loaded, or may need to set state before
loading the code to be tested, or may need to change values inside
the package containing it.  Having a separate system for tests
allows these different usecases to be supported gracefully.


** Defining the System
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       e1883120-d8ea-462e-85f7-6614cc9bec04
   :END:

Systems are defined in an =.asd= file, using [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf/The-defsystem-form.html][the =DEFSYSTEM= form]].
To maintain good separation of concerns, the Hello World project
needs two systems: one for the core, and one for the CLI.  For
these examples, I’ll be using the CLI system to demonstrate.  If
someone wanted to reuse the core =GREET= code in their own program[fn:5],
they’d use that system.

#+begin_src lisp
  (defsystem :hello)
#+end_src

There are multiple strategies for loading code, but the easiest is
to load components in the order they appear in the system
definition.  This is indicated with =:serial t=:

#+begin_src lisp
  (defsystem :hello
    :serial t)
#+end_src

Then, the components need to be specified.  These are the files and
directories the make up the system:

#+name: defsystem-hello
#+begin_src lisp
  (defsystem :hello
    :components ((:file "packages")
                 (:module "src"
                          :serial t
                          :components ((:file "greet")))))
#+end_src

Then a secondary system for the binary.  The only new thing is
=:depends-on=, which indicates that this system relies on the
earlier one.

#+name: defsystem-main
#+begin_src lisp
  (defsystem :hello/bin
    :depends-on (:hello)      ; This system needs the core HELLO system…
    :components ((:module :src
                  :components ((:file "main"))))) ; …and includes one
                                                  ; additional file.
#+end_src


Putting the two declarations together into =hello.asd= results in:

#+begin_src lisp
  (defsystem :hello
    :components ((:file "packages")
                 (:module "src"
                          :serial t
                          :components ((:file "greet")))))


  (defsystem :hello/bin
    :depends-on (:hello)      ; This system needs the core HELLO system…
    :components ((:module :src
                  :components ((:file "main"))))) ; …and includes one
                                                  ; additional file.
#+end_src

Since the system defines the files and load order, the build script
doesn’t need to replicate that anymore; it can lean on Quicklisp
and ASDF instead:

#+name: build-v3
#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :hello/bin)

  (sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die "hello"
   :toplevel 'hello:main
   :executable t)
#+end_src

ASDF needs to be told where to find the system definition, and all
others it should be able to load.  This is [[https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/asdf.html#Configuring-ASDF-to-find-your-systems][a complex topic]], but the
simplest approach is:

1. Use Quicklisp.
2. Make a symlink from [[http://blog.quicklisp.org/2018/01/the-quicklisp-local-projects-mechanism.html][Quicklisp’s =local-projects=]] directory, named
   after the project, which points to the source tree.

This is easily the grossest thing about this entire setup.

#+begin_src shell
  rm ~/quicklisp/local-projects/{hello,system-index.txt}
  ln -sf $PWD/v3 ~/quicklisp/local-projects/hello
#+end_src

#+results:

The rest of the source is unchanged from v2.

Running works the same way:

* Version 4: Using Libraries
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       ef05a3a0-9f78-453f-aaea-211162b186a4
  :END:

The final step is to replace UIOP’s basic program arguments with a
more full-featured library, [[https://github.com/libre-man/unix-opts][unix-opts.]]

Common Lisp libraries are installed via [[https://www.quicklisp.org/][Quicklisp]], and loaded with
ASDF.  As with other Common Lisp tasks, actually installing the
library is done from the REPL.


** Quicklisp
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       1f41f38b-9d32-4b10-9b1c-5b6b54e384e6
   :END:

Quicklisp is not a package manager like other languages have.
There’s no project-specific setup, like with virtualenv or rbenv.
There’s no [[https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--asKSgsVB--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_420,q_auto,w_1000/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/9i6bs4g6cx05jeagfhum.png][=node_modules=]].

Quicklisp is more of a caching mechanism than a package manager.
Similar to Maven’s =~/.m2=, a single copy of the code is stored in
=~/quicklisp/dist/quicklisp/installed=.  ASDF looks there when
asked to load systems into a Lisp environment.

As with other tooling, the primary interface for Quicklisp is the
Lisp environment.


** Installing unix-opts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       88da6759-0fef-4e1a-b284-fbe035853e29
   :END:

The [[https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/][Quicklisp documentation]] discusses this, but I’m going to cover
the essentials.

Quicklisp has =QL:SYSTEM-APROPOS=, which searches available
libraries:

#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:system-apropos "unix")
#+end_src

#+results:
: #<SYSTEM deoxybyte-unix / deoxybyte-unix-20140113-git / quicklisp 2020-06-10>
: #<SYSTEM deoxybyte-unix-test / deoxybyte-unix-20140113-git / quicklisp 2020-06-10>
: #<SYSTEM unix-options / unix-options-20151031-git / quicklisp 2020-06-10>
: #<SYSTEM unix-opts / unix-opts-20200610-git / quicklisp 2020-06-10>
: #<SYSTEM unix-opts/tests / unix-opts-20200610-git / quicklisp 2020-06-10>


Installing is done with =QL:QUICKLOAD=.  This downloads the library
(if necessary) and loads its system:

#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload "unix-opts")
#+end_src


** Defining the Systems
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       0872ec61-7803-4db5-b452-aff4e2d85cbd
   :END:

The only change to the system definitions is adding =:unix-opts= to
the =:depends-on= form.  *Note that this refers to the /system/,
not the package*.  Systems /provide/ packages, and /depend on/
other systems.  Because =build.lisp= uses =QL:QUICKLOAD= to load
the system, it’ll notice if =unix-opts= (or any other system in
=:depends-on=) hasn’t been installed, and do that automatically.

** The New =MAIN=
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       ef394b10-3876-4938-8849-30fd2a9b75ac
   :END:

With the =:unix-opts= system loaded, the =:unix-opts= package is
available for =MAIN= to use:

#+begin_src lisp
  (in-package :hello)

  (unix-opts:define-opts
    (:name :help
     :description "Print this help text"
     :short #\h
     :long "help"))

  (defun main ()
    "Greet someone, or something."
    (multiple-value-bind (options free-args)
        (unix-opts:get-opts)
      (if (or (getf options :help) (/= (length free-args) 1))
          (unix-opts:describe
           :prefix "A Hello World program."
           :args "WHOM")
          (write-line (greet (first free-args)))))

    (uiop:quit))
#+end_src

Nothing needs to change in any of the other source files.

** Building
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       d979f181-4814-43c3-93fb-cdd929f26b5a
   :END:

For this to work, the Quicklisp =local-projects= symlink created in
v3 needs to be updated to point here instead:

#+begin_src shell
  rm ~/quicklisp/local-projects/{hello,system-index.txt}
  ln -sf $PWD/v4 ~/quicklisp/local-projects/hello
#+end_src

…and the ASDF registry cleared:

#+begin_src lisp
  (asdf:clear-source-registry)
#+end_src

After building (using the same commands as previously), the new
options parser is working:

#+name: build-v4
#+begin_src shell
  sbcl --non-interactive --load build.lisp
#+end_src

#+results: build-v4
#+begin_example

At over four thousand words, this piece has been *a lot more* than I
set out to write.  The process of learning, organizing, and refining
my own understanding has been wonderful.  I hope you’ve been able to
take away some of that, and will go forth with useful new tools.
